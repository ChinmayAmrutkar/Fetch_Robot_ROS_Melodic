# ü¶æ Fetch Robot Control Suite (ROS Melodic - Ubuntu 18.04)

This repository contains a ROS-based modular control system for the **Fetch robot** in simulation. It allows for:

- ‚úÖ Navigation to a 2D goal using velocity control  
- ‚úÖ Orienting the robot head to look at a 3D point  
- ‚úÖ Full 6-DOF Cartesian control of the arm using MoveIt (with roll-pitch-yaw support)  
- ‚úÖ Move robot arm to "home/tuck" position  
- ‚úÖ Gripper open/close control via action client  
- ‚úÖ Basic pick and place at a known object location

## üß∞ System Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04  
- ROS Melodic  
- Gazebo 9  
- MoveIt for Fetch  
- Fetch simulation packages:

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
  ros-melodic-fetch-gazebo \
  ros-melodic-fetch-gazebo-demo \
  ros-melodic-fetch-moveit-config \
  ros-melodic-control-msgs
```

---

## ‚úÖ Setup Instructions

### 1. Create and Build the Workspace

```bash
mkdir -p ~/fetch_ws/src
cd ~/fetch_ws
catkin_make
echo "source ~/fetch_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
cd ~/fetch_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ChinmayAmrutkar/Fetch_Robot_ROS_Melodic.git fetch_position_controller
cd ~/fetch_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

---

## üöÄ Launching the System

### Step 1: Start Simulation with Custom Objects

```bash
roslaunch fetch_position_controller custom_simulation.launch
```

This loads:
- A custom Gazebo world (`random_objects.world`)
- Fetch robot with full sensors and controllers

### Step 2: Start MoveIt! for Arm Control

```bash
roslaunch fetch_moveit_config move_group.launch
```

Required for enabling motion planning with MoveIt.

---

## üéÆ Use Individual Controllers

### ‚û§ 1. Base Navigation Controller

```bash
rosrun fetch_position_controller go_to_point.py
```

Prompts:
```
Enter goal x: 1.5
Enter goal y: 0.5
```

### ‚û§ 2. Head Gaze Controller

```bash
rosrun fetch_position_controller look_at_point.py
```

Prompts:
```
Enter point to look at (x, y, z):
```

### ‚û§ 3. MoveIt Arm + Gripper Controller

```bash
rosrun fetch_position_controller moveit_arm_control.py
```

You can select from:

```
Choose mode:
[1] Go to Cartesian pose (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)
[2] Go to tucked (home) joint pose
[3] Open gripper
[4] Close gripper
```

### ‚û§ 4. Pick and Place Demo

```bash
rosrun fetch_position_controller pick_and_place.py
```

Performs an automated **pick and place** operation:
- Moves the base to a known object (e.g., small cylinder on a blue cube)
- Grasps it using the arm and gripper
- Moves back and places the object at a defined drop location  
This uses hardcoded known coordinates for both pickup and placement poses (no vision yet).

## üõ†Ô∏è Helpful Tools

- To get current end-effector pose:
  ```bash
  rosrun tf tf_echo base_link wrist_roll_link
  ```

- To see joint states:
  ```bash
  rostopic echo /joint_states
  ```

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- [x] Go to arbitrary 2D base position  
- [x] Point head to 3D location  
- [x] Move arm to 6-DOF Cartesian target (x, y, z, RPY)  
- [x] Go to custom joint-space home/tucked pose
